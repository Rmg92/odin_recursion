This project is divided in two parts.
The first one consists in:
* Creating a method that takes a number and outputs an array with as many numbers from the fibonacci sequence, this method should use iteration.
* Create a similar method as the above one but using recursion.

The second part consists in:
* Building a #merge_sort method that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
